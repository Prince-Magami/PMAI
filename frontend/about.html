    <h2>ABOUT PM-AI</h2>
   <p>
  PMAI — short for Prince Magami AI — was born out of a deep desire to create something truly meaningful and relevant to Nigerians. 
     I wanted to build an AI that feels local, speaks our language, understands our problems, and responds in a way that feels human. 
     Most of the popular AI tools out there don’t connect with everyday people around here. They’re either too technical, too foreign, or too abstract. 
     PMAI breaks that barrier. It’s designed for anyone — the student trying to pass WAEC or JAMB, the business owner wary of scam links,
     the curious learner looking for guidance, or even someone who just wants to chat. I kept it fast, simple, and open — no login required, 
     no complex setup — just select your mode and get real, useful results.
</p>

<p>
  One of the biggest problems we face in Nigeria is online fraud. A lot of people receive suspicious emails or links daily — through WhatsApp, Facebook,
  emails, or even job offers — and many don’t know how to tell what’s real and what’s not. That’s why I built the <strong>Email/Link Scanner
  </strong> mode into PMAI. It allows users to paste any suspicious content and instantly get a trust analysis with a clear verdict. 
  It’s something I know will help business people, job seekers, influencers, and everyday phone users stay safer online. Then there’s the 
  <strong>Academic Assistant</strong>, which isn’t just for school students. It’s a full educational mode powered by flashcards, learning tips, 
  and direct question-answering. Whether you're preparing for JAMB, WAEC, or even an aptitude test for a job, it adapts to you and helps you study smarter. 
  I added helpful links to top academic websites as well — because guidance matters.
</p>

<p>
  What makes PMAI even more personal to me is the <strong>Cybersecurity Tips</strong> mode — a direct reflection of the cybersecurity knowledge I’ve gained from the 3MTT program. 
  I didn’t want to keep that knowledge to myself. So I trained PMAI to share the kind of safety tips that anyone — even without a tech background — can understand and apply. 
  From explaining phishing and 2FA in plain language to offering general cyber hygiene advice, it’s like having a cybersecurity coach in your pocket. Altogether, PMAI isn’t just a chatbot. 
  It’s a blend of culture, experience, AI, and purpose — made for Nigerians by someone who understands what we truly need from tech today.
