    <h1>About PMAI</h1>
    <p>
      Hello, I’m Prince Magami — and this is PMAI (Prince Magami AI). Built for ease, speed, and value,
      PMAI is more than just a chatbot. It’s a virtual assistant designed to be powerful enough for tech enthusiasts,
      and friendly enough for the average Nigerian student or business owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      PMAI was created to bridge knowledge gaps and help you interact with AI in a way that feels human,
      familiar, and effective. Whether you’re scanning suspicious links, seeking cybersecurity advice,
      getting academic help, or just want to chat — PMAI is ready.
    </p>
    <h2>Modes Available</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chatbox:</strong> Ask anything. Get casual or informative responses in seconds.</li>
      <li><strong>Email/Link Scanner:</strong> Paste a message or URL. PMAI evaluates and gives a risk score.</li>
      <li><strong>Academic Assistant:</strong> Get access to study help, exam advice, and academic resources.</li>
      <li><strong>Cybersecurity Tips:</strong> Learn basic to advanced cyber practices simplified for everyone.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why PMAI?</h2>
    <p>
      It was born out of the 3MTT Knowledge Showcase initiative and built solo by me. The goal? Simplicity.
      Something fast, accessible, and useful for real-life problems — without logins, without limits.
