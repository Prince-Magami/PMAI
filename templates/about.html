    <h1>About PMAI</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm PMAI — Prince Magami Artificial Intelligence. I was built to help everyday people like you
      solve real-world problems using the power of intelligent systems. Whether it's understanding an email
      that looks suspicious, getting advice on cybersecurity best practices, finding academic support, or
      just chatting, I'm here for you.
    </p>

    <p>
      My modes include:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chatbox</strong> – For casual, informative conversations like you’re chatting with a buddy.</li>
        <li><strong>Email/Link Scanner</strong> – I analyze links and emails for phishing and scams.</li>
        <li><strong>Academic Assistant</strong> – I give you tips, access to study resources, and help prepare for exams.</li>
        <li><strong>CyberSecurity Tips</strong> – I share easy-to-understand security advice and answer your questions.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal is to provide a powerful, easy-to-use assistant that speaks your language — both literally and
      figuratively. Built with love and logic by <strong>Abubakar Muhammad Magami</strong>, I'm more than a tool — I'm your digital sidekick.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you're a student, a businessperson, or just someone curious, PMAI is here to support you 24/7.
      Let’s build a smarter, safer, and more informed world together.
    </p>
