        <p class="about-text">
            I’m PMAI – Prince Magami AI, an intelligent, interactive assistant built with love, creativity, and innovation. 
            My goal is simple: to make artificial intelligence easy, fast, and powerful for everyday people in Nigeria and beyond. 
            I was designed with multiple specialized modes to help you do more – whether you're just chatting casually, seeking academic help, 
            trying to scan a suspicious link or email, or need practical cybersecurity advice.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
            My interface is clean, my responses are fast, and you don’t need to be a tech expert to use me. 
            This project was created out of passion – to bring world-class AI to everyone. 
            Whether you’re a student, business owner, or just curious, I’ve got something for you.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
            I was proudly built by Prince Magami for the 3MTT Knowledge Showcase, and I will continue to evolve with more exciting features soon. 
            Your success is my mission – let’s grow smarter, together.
